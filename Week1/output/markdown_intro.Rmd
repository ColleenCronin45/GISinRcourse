## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, cache = TRUE, fig.width = 4, fig.asp = 1, fig.align = "center"}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Markdown lists

Unordered list

* boy
* howdy

Ordered list

1. hello
1. world

## Styling markdown text

Text can be *italic*, **bold**, <span style = "color:red">different colors</span>, or <span style ="font-size:24px; color:blue">different sizes</span>.
